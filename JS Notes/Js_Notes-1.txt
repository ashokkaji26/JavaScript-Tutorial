******************************* JavaScript Notes - 1 ***********************************

---> Console works in "REPL" - Read, Evaluate, Print, & Loop principle.
---> JavaScript automatically fetch the types of variables/data, we don't need explicitely to define data types.


1. variables :- It is simply a name of storage location.  
---> Each variables have a data limit, means we can't store unlimited data in some variable.

2. Data types in JavaScript :-
                    * Primitive types :- sabse basic & sabse fundamental
                                        1. Number :- Integers, decimal nos. eg:- 1, -4, 0.5, -4.5 etc.
                                        2. Boolean :- 
                                        3. String
                                        4. Undefined
                                        5. Null
                                        6. Bigint
                                        7. Symbol 


3. Operations in JavaScript :- 
--> operands :- jiske uper Operation perform kiya jata h.
--> operators :- Jo operation perform karega. 
--> operators :- 1. + addition
                 2. - subtraction
                 3. * multiplication 
                 4. / division
                 5. % modulo(remainder operator)
                 6. ** exponentiation(power operator)


4. NaN(Not a Number) :- NaN is a JavaScript property, and it is a number which represents invalid numbers. eg:- 0/0.
--> operations can be perform with NaN but the answers will be also Nan.


--> precedence = priority.
5. Operator precedence :- kisi expression ko solve karne ke liye operators ka priority.
                            1.   (bracket)

                            2.   ** (power)

                            3.   * , / , %

                            4.   + , -

                            --> in case of same priority we follow Left to right rule. 
                            --> in case of multiple power opertor only follow right to left rule.


6. Keywords in JavaScript :- these are reserved words which have fixed meanings, and can't use as a variable or something else.

--> (a.) Let Keyword :- It helps declare variables.
                     --> eg:- let age = 22; let b; let num = 13; etc.
                     --> let Keyword ko hm bas ek bar starting me variable declare karte time likhte h,
                      bad me us variable me changes karte time let ko dubara use nhi karenge.

--> (b.) const Keyword :- Ye constant variables ko declare karne ke liye use hota h, jiska value hmesha fixed 
                          rahega aur bad me is value ko change nhi kar sakte. 

--> (c.) var Keyword :- old syntax of writing variables. eg:- var age = 23;
                      --> we will not use this to declare variables, instead of this we will use let Keyword.
